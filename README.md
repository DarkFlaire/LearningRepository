# Learning Repository
For use for the learning of code and other things

Hello. Welcome to the Learning Repository, which should have enough information and challenges in it to get you up to speed in the realm of coding (Or, at least, enough to get you by in whatever material your class covers).

Here is a list of all of the things I had planned to cover before things got busy:
* Abstract Data Structures
	* Linked Lists
	* Stacks
	* Queues
	* Graphs
	* Heaps
	* Trees
* Big O Notation (What does it mean? What does it do?)
* Review: Classes
	* Inheritance: Superclasses and Subclasses
	* Polymorphism/Basic Class Structure
	* Overloaded Methods and Flexibility
	* Abstract Classes and Interfaces

*Misc.
	* Ruby: What It Is and Why It's Useful
	* SQL and SQL Injection

If I think of anything else I'll add it here.
